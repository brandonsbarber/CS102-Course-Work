CS102-Course-Work
=================

A collection of assignments from my CSCI102 class from the Spring 2013 Semester

  - **PA1 - Social Network**
    - A program that creates a social network from an input `.gml`, adds and removes friendships as defined in a command file, and then outputs the results of these changes to another `.gml`.
  - **PA2 - Betweenness Centrality**
    - A program that extends PA1. Generates the betweenness centrality of users involved in the social network and outputs to a `.txt` file.
  - **PA3 - Tile Puzzle**
    - A terminal-based sliding tile game. Deals in square sizes (9,16,25,etc) and scrambles based on given parameters.
  - **PA4 - Tile Puzzle in Qt**
    - Another version of the puzzle game using Qt instead of the terminal.
  - **PA5 - The Journey of Kale**
    - Qt game created entirely from the ground up for a final class project

###Additional Notes###
These were developed on a VirtualBox running Ubuntu Linux. PA4 and PA5 were developed using Qt.
